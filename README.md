    install        Install a specified JTD repository
    interactive    Interactively install dotfiles
    sync           Sync the currently installed JTD repository with the provided remote repo.
```

## About

jointhedots works by reading a "jtd.yaml" manifest file located within your dotfile repository. The manifest contains a mapping of file to installed location (amongst other things), allowing for JTD to automatically install configurations. `pre_install` and `post_install` commands can also be specified, allowing for additional control over installation.

**WARNING: Be very careful about installing dotfiles via untrusted manifests. The pre_install and post_install blocks allow for (potentially malicious) code execution**. JTD will prompt you to confirm you trust a manifest if it contains install steps.

| Abort syncing if no changes are present in files                                     |             |                    |

## Example

An example manifest file is shown below:
```yaml
nvim:
  file: init.vim
  pre_install:
    - sudo apt install nvim
  target: ~/.config/nvim/init.vim

nvim-coc:
  file: coc-settings.json
  target: ~/.config/nvim/coc-settings.json

kitty:
  file: kitty.conf
  target: ~/.config/kitty/kitty.conf

kitty-theme:
  file: theme.conf
  target: ~/.config/kitty/theme.conf

fish:
  file: config.fish
  target: ~/.config/fish/config.fish
```
The manifest file should be located in the root of the repository and called "jtd.yaml".

A JSON Schema for the manifest is available [here](https://github.com/dob9601/jointhedots/blob/master/src/dotfile_schema.json). This can be used in conjunction with certain plugins to provide language server support for jtd manifests.

## Download

Grab the latest version [here](https://github.com/dob9601/jointhedots/releases/latest/download/jtd)!
Or use the following 1 liner to 1-off run JTD to install your dotfiles
```sh
curl -sL jtd.danielobr.ie | sh
